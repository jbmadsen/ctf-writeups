## Task

> Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 35225. Files can be found here: [passwd](Files/passwd) [shadow](Files/shadow). 

## Hints

> If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And again. And again.

> If you're not careful these kind of problems can really "rockyou".
