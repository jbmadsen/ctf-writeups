# Forensics Warmup 1

**Category:** Forensics

**Points:** 50

## Task

> Can you unzip this [file](Files/flag.zip) for me and retreive the flag? 

## Hints

> Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}

## What do we need to know?

I suspect the first warmup challenge is just to make sure the participants are clued in on how the flag is structured, and is basically giving it away, if you have ever unpacked a zip file.

The hint also tells us to remember the format of the flag.

## Solution

Unzip the flag using the following command in a terminal: 

```
unzip flag.zip
```

Read the flag manually from the unpacked image.
