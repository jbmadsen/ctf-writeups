**Category:** Binary Exploitation

**Points:** 150

## Task

>  Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this [program](Files/vuln) to get the flag? You can also find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-0_1_316c391426b9319fbdfb523ee15b37db on the shell server. [Source](Files/vuln.c). 


## Hints

> How can you trigger the flag to print?

> If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
