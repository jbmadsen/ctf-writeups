# [PicoCTF 2018](https://2018game.picoctf.com/) Writeup

These write-ups explains the things I learned solving the tasks. Since this was the first CTF I did, some of the methods used getting the right answers might not be conventional, and some might be downright stupid in hindsight and with more knowledge :)

But you know what you know, I guess. 

**Note:** All writeup will be using Linux to solve the challenges.
